# REUSE Compliant Repository for Testing

This repository is part of the testing infrastructure of the [reuse-lint-action](https://github.com/Imamiland/reuse-lint-action) GitHub Action.

## REUSE Background

[REUSE](https://reuse.software) is an effort by the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org) to standardize the inclusion of license and copyright information and make it easy for both humans and machines.

## REUSE Compliance

This repository is the REUSE _noncompliant_ repository. That is to say that this repository does not comply with the [REUSE Specification - Version 3.2](https://reuse.software/spec-3.2/). The nature of the noncompliance is:

- Two files do not have any license or copyright information
- One file has only license information without copyright information
- One file has only copyright information without license information
