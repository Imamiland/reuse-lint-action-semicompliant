# Mistakes to Avoid as an Evil Overlord

Learn from the mistakes of those who came before you. Remember: a prepared villain is a successful villain!

1. **Don't Monologue** - Your evil plan is fantastic, we know, but save the speech for after it’s all over.
2. **Guard the Escape Hatch** - Why does every evil lair have an unguarded escape route? Put a guard there. Or five.
3. **Don’t Underestimate the Sidekick** - They may look small and harmless, but these side characters are surprisingly resourceful.
4. **Avoid Overly Complex Plans** - If it requires too many moving parts, it’s bound to fail. Keep it simple!
5. **Invest in Comfortable Furniture** - You’ll be spending a lot of time in your lair; make sure it’s ergonomic.
6. **Have a Backup Plan** - Heroes are annoyingly good at finding weak points. Always have an escape plan ready.

Happy Overlording!
